By checking Web pages		    for barriers to accessibility, HTML Tidy will ensure that you are		    reaching the widest possible audience. HTML Tidy is based on the		    guidelines for accessibility which are created and maintained by		    the <a HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Access Initiative</a> of			the <a HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Con</a>		</p>		<p>			This software is made available through a joint collaboration between			the <a HREF="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/">Adaptive Technology Resource			Centre (ATRC)</a> at the University of Toronto and the			<a HREF="http://trace.wisc.edu/">TRACE Center</a> at the University of			Wisconsin. These research centres are dedicated to			improving the accessibility and usability of information			technologies by people with disabilities. Partial funding for this project			was provided by the Ontario government's Telecommunications Access Partnership			(TAP) program and the U.S. National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation			Research (NIDRR).		</p>	</body></html>
