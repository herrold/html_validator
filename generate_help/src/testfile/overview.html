Over the last few years the		  situation has improved considerably in terms of the web compatibility of access		  technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, and alternative mouse systems.		  However, the web pages themselves need to be designed with a wide range of users		  in mind, and authors may also include HTML access features that optimize access		  to users with disabilities.		</p>		<p>One strategy for increasing the accessibility of the millions of web pages		  designed each year is the development of tools for checking HTML.  HTML Tidy		  is a utility currently being developed to provide this important		  support for web authors. This initiative has been undertaken as a joint		  collaboration between the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at the University		  of Toronto and the Trace Centre at the University of Wisconsin.		</p>	</body></html>
