<p>All images require text equivalents, but "<a href="/wiki/Access_1.1.1.1" title="Access 1.1.1.1">alt</a>" text must also meet certain criteria.  Unusually long alt text may be considered suspicious, because it could potentially be part of an attempt to hijack the web browser. If "alt" text exceeds 150 characters, use the "longdesc" attribute along with a descriptive link (d-link) to describe the image.
