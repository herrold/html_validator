opensp (1.5pre5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * ship PO files in libosp package
  * some upstream changes from CVS, not yet released; this version will
    call itself 1.5pre6, however
  * nsgmls: apply a patch which should enable compilation on gcc 3.0
    closes: #103791
  * debian/rules: make maintainer-clean upstream is incredibly fragile,
    so tolerate errors there until that gets fixed
  * debian/rules: during build, run libtoolize --force to replace this
    libtoolize stuff, which is needed for arches which diverge from the
    libtool stuff OpenSP ships with
    closes: #101837, #104126
  * debian/rules, control: use dh_shlibdeps, remove some hand-rolled stuff
    here which was unnecessary and in fact adding two libosp deps on the
    opensp package, not to mention that it stopped working
