libosp2 and libosp-dev: OpenSP development support for Debian
--------------------------------------------------------------

Include files from libosp-dev are available in /usr/include/osp .
You might have to add this to the compiler switches.

Documentation on this library is available in the 'opensp' package,
in the Section "Programming with OpenSP".

One other note: unless you include "osp/config.h" first of all, you will
get errors. The Debian version of libosp is compiled with multibyte
support, so you may need to compile with:

 #define SP_MULTI_BYTE
 #include <osp/config.h>
